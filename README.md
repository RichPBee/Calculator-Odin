# Calculator-Odin
Creating a calculator for The Odin Project. 


The aim of this project is to create a functioning standard numerical calculator. This will be styled in the format of a typical desk/large-button calculator, as opposed to a scientific calculator. Following additions may include more complex mathematical functions and redesigning of the GUI. 

A hypothetical outline of the project: 
- Create functions for each of the basic mathematical operators.
- Create a function that takes an operator as an argument, and calls one of the above functions. 
- Design a GUI wirefram of the calculator using HTML and simple CSS formatting. 
- Style the wireframe to an appropriate level (colours and layouts)
- Design the JS functionality for the calculator display. 
- Complete the calculation logic, noting that numbers are supposed to be evaluated in pairs. i.e. (12 + 7  + 4 + 19) = ((12 + 7) + 4) + 19
- Complete styling (including fonts, click actions for the buttons)
